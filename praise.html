<h1>Praise for <em>Ansible: Up and Running</em></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>I devoured the manuscript for the first edition of <em>Ansible: Up and Running</em> within a few hours: Lorin did an amazing job describing all of Ansible's facets, and I was excited to hear he'd joined forces with René for a second edition. In this, the two authors have done an outstanding job of showing us how to put an incredibly useful utility to good use, and I cannot think of anything they haven't covered in depth.</p>

  <p>Impressive coverage of Ansible. It's not only great for getting started, but also for understanding how to use the more advanced features. Fantastic resource for <span class="keep-together">leveling up your Ansible skills</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nice thing about Ansible is that you can start by doing, and that it lends itself for <span class="keep-together">easy prototyping,</span> which is great to make quick progress and get things done. <span class="keep-together">However, over time</span> this tends to lead to gaps in knowledge and understanding, <span class="keep-together">which is hard to come by</span>.</p>

<p><em>Ansible: Up and Running</em> is a very useful resource because it can fill those gaps, as it explains Ansible from the very basics up to the complexities of working with YAML and Jinja2. And because it is packed with many off-the-shelf examples to learn from and build on, it gives insight into how others are automating their environments.</p>

<p>During training sessions and hands-on missions over the past few years, I always recommend this book to colleagues and customers.</p>

  <p>This book gives everyone an easy start, but also a deep dive into Ansible configuration management. There are a lot of hints and how-tos and it covers a wide range of use cases like AWS, Windows, and Docker.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lorin and René did an amazing job by writing this book. The authors take the user by the hand and lead him/her through all the important steps of creating and managing a properly designed Ansible project. The book is much more than a simple Ansible reference, as it covers several important conceptual topics missing from the official docs. It is an excellent resource for Ansible beginners, but it also includes many practical concepts and tricks for existing Ansiblers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ansible: Up and Running</em> brilliantly covers what you need to know, not only as a novice but also as someone who already knows their way around Ansible and wants to expand their repertoire.  Its differentiator is that it takes real world examples and explains both how to achieve tasks and why it works the way it does, leading to a much deeper understanding.</p>
