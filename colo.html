<p>The animal on the cover of <i>Ansible: Up and Running</i>&nbsp;is a Holstein Friesian&nbsp;<em>(Bos primigenius)</em>, often shortened to Holstein in North America and Friesian in Europe. This breed of cattle originated in Europe in what is now the Netherlands, bred with the goal of obtaining animals that could exclusively eat grass—the area's most abundant resource—resulting in a high-producing, black-and-white dairy cow. Holstein Friesians were introduced to the United States from 1621 to 1664, but American breeders didn't become interested in the breed until the 1830s.</p>

<p>Holsteins are known for their large size, distinct black-and-white markings, and high production of milk. The black and white coloring is a result of artificial selection by the breeders. Healthy calves weigh 90–100 pounds at birth; mature Holsteins can weigh up to 1,280 pounds and stand at 58 inches tall. Heifers of this breed are typically bred by 13 to 15 months; their gestation period is 9&frac12; months.</p>

<p>This breed of cattle averages about 2,022 gallons of milk per year; pedigree animals average 2,146 gallons per year, and can produce up to 6,898 gallons in a lifetime.</p>

<p>In September 2000, the Holstein became the center of controversy when one of its own, Hanoverhill Starbuck, was cloned from frozen fibroblast cells recovered one month before his death, birthing Starbuck II. The cloned calf was born 21 years and 5 months after the original Starbuck.</p>
