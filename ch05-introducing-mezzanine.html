<h1>Introducing Mezzanine: <span class="keep-together">Our Test Application</span></h1>


<p><a data-type="xref" href="#playbooks_a_beginning"/> covered the basics of writing playbooks. But
real life is always messier than introductory chapters of programming books, so in this chapter
we&#8217;re going to work through a complete example of deploying a nontrivial
application.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mezzanine"/></p>

<p>Our example application is an open source content management system (CMS) called <a href="http://mezzanine.jupo.org">Mezzanine</a>, which is similar in spirit to
WordPress. Mezzanine is built on top of Django, the free Python-based framework for writing web applications.</p>






<section data-type="sect1">
<h1>Why Deploying to Production Is Complicated</h1>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a little detour and talk about the differences between
running software in development mode on your laptop versus running the software
in production.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mezzanine" data-secondary="running in development mode"/> Mezzanine is a great example of an application that is much easier to run in
development mode than it is to deploy. <a data-type="xref" href="#mezzanine_dev_mode"/> shows all you need
to do to get Mezzanine running on your laptop.<span data-type="footnote">This installs the Python packages into a virtualenv. We cover virtualenvs in <a data-type="xref" href="#installing_mezzanine_virtualenv"/>.</span></p>
<div id="mezzanine_dev_mode" data-type="example">
<h5>Running Mezzanine in development mode</h5>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="console">$ virtualenv venv

<p>You&#8217;ll be prompted to answer several questions. I answered "yes" to each yes/no
question, and accepted the default answer whenever one was available. This was
what my interaction looked like:</p>

<p>If you point your browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/"><em class="hyperlink">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</em></a>, you should see
a web page that looks like <a data-type="xref" href="#mezzanine_figure"/>.</p>

<figcaption>Mezzanine after a fresh install</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Deploying this application to
production is another matter. When you run the <code>mezzanine-project</code> command,
Mezzanine will generate a <a href="http://www.fabfile.org">Fabric</a> deployment <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="mezzanine-project program"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Fabric deployment scripts"/>script at
<em>myproject/fabfile.py</em> that you can use to deploy your project to a production
server.  (Fabric is a Python-based tool that helps automate running tasks via
SSH.) The script is almost 700 lines
long, and that&#8217;s not counting the included configuration files that are also
involved in deployment. Why is deploying to production so much more complex? I&#8217;m
glad you asked.</p>

<p>When run in development, Mezzanine provides the following simplifications (see <a data-type="xref" href="#django_dev_arch"/>):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The system uses SQLite as the backend database, and will create the database file if it doesn&#8217;t exist.<a data-type="indexterm" id="sql5" data-primary="SQLite"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development HTTP server serves up both the static content (images, <em>.css</em> files, JavaScript) as well as the dynamically generated HTML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development HTTP server uses the (insecure) HTTP, not (secure) HTTPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development HTTP server process runs in the foreground, taking over your terminal window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hostname for the HTTP server is always 127.0.0.1 (<code>localhost</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>PostgreSQL: The Database</h2>

<p>SQLite is a serverless database.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mezzanine" data-secondary="deploying to production" data-tertiary="Gunicorn application server"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="PostgreSQL" data-secondary="to production"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="PostgreSQL"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="sql5"/> In production, we want to run a
server-based database, because those have better support for multiple, concurrent requests, and server-based databases allow us to run multiple HTTP servers for load balancing. This means we need to deploy a database management system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL (aka Postgres). Setting up one of these database servers requires more work. We need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install the database software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure the database service is running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the database inside the database management system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a database user who has the appropriate permissions for the database <span class="keep-together">system.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure our Mezzanine application with the database user credentials and connection information.</p>
</li>

<h2>Gunicorn: The Application Server</h2>

<p>Because Mezzanine is a Django-based application, you can run Mezzanine using Django&#8217;s HTTP server, referred as the <em>development server</em> in <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="development server"/>the
Django documentation.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mezzanine" data-secondary="Gunicorn application server"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="application server (Gunicorn)"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Gunicorn (application server)"/> Here&#8217;s what the Django 1.10 docs have to say about the <a href="http://bit.ly/2cPe8X8">development server</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[D]on’t use this server in anything resembling a production environment. It&#8217;s
intended only for use while developing. (We’re in the business of making Web
frameworks, not Web servers.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Django implements the <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)"/>standard Web Server Gateway Interface
(WSGI),<span data-type="footnote">The WSGI protocol is documented in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333">Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 3333</a>.</span> so any Python
HTTP server that supports WSGI is suitable for running a Django application such as Mezzanine. We&#8217;ll use Gunicorn, one of the most popular HTTP WSGI
servers, which is what the Mezzanine deploy script uses.</p>
</section>













<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Nginx: The Web Server</h2>

<p>Gunicorn will execute our Django application, just like the development server
does. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="static assets"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mezzanine" data-secondary="deploying to production" data-tertiary="Nginx web server"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Nginx" data-secondary="web server for Mezzanine application"/>However, Gunicorn won&#8217;t serve any of the static assets associated with the
application. <em>Static assets</em> are files such as images, <em>.css</em> files, and
JavaScript files. They are called static because they never change, in contrast
with the dynamically generated web pages that Gunicorn serves up.</p>

<p>Although Gunicorn can handle TLS encryption, it&#8217;s common to configure Nginx to handle the encryption.<span data-type="footnote">Gunicorn 0.17 added support for TLS encryption. Before that, you had to use a separate application such as Nginx to handle the encryption.</span></p>

<p>We&#8217;re going to use Nginx as our web server for serving static assets and for
handling the TLS encryption, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#nginx_reverse_proxy_image"/>.</p>

<figure id="nginx_reverse_proxy_image">
<img src="images/aur2_0503.png" alt="Nginx as a reverse proxy"/>
<figcaption>Nginx as a reverse proxy</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We
need to configure Nginx as a <em>reverse proxy</em> for Gunicorn.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="reverse proxy"/> If the request is for
a static asset, such as a <em>.css</em> file, Nginx will serve that file directly
from the local filesystem. Otherwise, Nginx will proxy the request to Gunicorn,
by making an HTTP request against the Gunicorn service that is running on the
local machine. Nginx uses the URL to determine whether to serve a local file or
proxy the request to Gunicorn.  Note that requests to Nginx will be (encrypted)
HTTPS, and all requests that Nginx proxies to Gunicorn will be (unencrypted)
HTTP.</p>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Supervisor: The Process Manager</h2>

<p>When we run in development mode, we run the application server in the foreground
of our terminal.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mezzanine" data-secondary="deploying to production" data-tertiary="Supervisor process manager"/> If we were to close our terminal, the program would
terminate. For a server application, we need it to run as a background process
so it doesn&#8217;t terminate, even if we close the terminal session we used to
start the process.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="background process, server application running in"/></p>

<p>The colloquial terms for such a process are  <em>daemon</em> or <em>service</em>.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="daemons"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="services"/> We need to run Gunicorn as
a daemon, and we&#8217;d like to be able to easily stop it and restart it. Numerous service managers can do this job. We&#8217;re going to use
Supervisor, because that&#8217;s what the Mezzanine deployment scripts use.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Supervisor (service manager)"/></p>

<p>At this point, you should have a sense of the steps involved in deploying
a web application to production. We&#8217;ll go over how to implement this deployment with Ansible in <a data-type="xref" href="#deploying_mezzanine"/>.</p>
