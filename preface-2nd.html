<h1>Preface to the Second Edition</h1>


<p>In the time since the first edition of the book was written (back in 2014), there have been
big changes in the world of Ansible. The Ansible project completed a major
release, hitting 2.0. Big changes happened outside the project as well:
Ansible, Inc., the company that backs the Ansible project, was acquired by Red Hat.
Red Hat&#8217;s acquisition hasn&#8217;t slowed the Ansible project at all: it&#8217;s still
in active development and gaining users.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve made multiple changes in this edition. The most significant
change is the addition of five new chapters. The book now covers callback plugins, Windows
hosts, network hardware, and Ansible Tower.  We added so much content to the
"Complex Playbooks" chapter that we expanded to a second chapter called
"Customizing Hosts, Runs and Handlers." We also rewrote the "Docker" chapter
to cover the new Docker modules.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve updated all of the example code for compatibility with Ansible 2.3. In
particular, the deprecated <code>sudo</code> clause has been replaced everywhere with
<code>become</code>. We also removed references to deprecated modules such as <code>docker</code>,
<code>ec2_vpc</code>, and <code>ec2_ami_search</code> and replaced them with examples that use newer
modules. The "Vagrant" chapter now covers the Ansible local provisioner, the
"Amazon EC2" chapter now covers the Packer Ansible remote provisioner, the
"Making Ansible Go Even Faster" chapter now covers asynchronous tasks, and the
"Debugging Ansible Playbooks" chapter now covers the debugger that was introduced in
version 2.1.</p>

<p>There are also minor changes. For example, OpenSSH switched from
using hexadecimal-encoded MD5 fingerprints to base64-encoded SHA256
fingerprints, and we updated examples accordingly. Finally, we fixed errata submitted by readers.</p>

<h1>A Note About Language</h1>

<p>The first edition of the book had a single author, and often used the
first-person singular <em>I</em>. Since this edition has two authors, the use of
first-person singular might seem odd in some places. However, we decided to keep
it because it is typically used to express the opinion of one of the authors.</p>
