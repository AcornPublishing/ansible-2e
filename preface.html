<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>When I was writing my first web application, using Django, the popular Python-based framework, I remember the sense of
accomplishment when the app was finally working
on my desktop. I would run <code>django manage.py runserver</code>, point my
browser to <em>http://localhost:8000</em>, and there was my web application in all its
glory.</p>

<p>Then I discovered there were all of these&#8230;<em>things</em> I had to do, just to get
the darned app to run on the Linux server. In addition to installing Django and
my app onto the server, I had to install Apache and the <code>mod_python</code> module so
that Apache could run Django apps. Then I had to figure out the right Apache
configuration file incantation so that it would run my application and serve up
the static assets properly.</p>

<p>None of it was hard; it was just a pain to get all of those details right. I
didn&#8217;t want to muck about with configuration files; I just wanted my app to run.
Once I got it working, everything was fine&#8230;until, several months
later, I had to do it again, on a different server, at which point I had to
start the process all over again.</p>

<p>Eventually, I discovered that this process was Doing It Wrong. The right way to do this
sort of thing has a name, and that name is <em>configuration management</em>. The great
thing about using configuration management is that it&#8217;s a way to capture
knowledge that always stays up-to-date. No more hunting for the right doc page
or searching through your old notes.</p>

<p>Recently, a colleague at work was interested in trying out Ansible for deploying
a new project, and he asked me for a reference on how to apply the Ansible
concepts in practice, beyond what was available in the official docs. I didn&#8217;t
know what else to recommend, so I decided to write something to fill the gap—and here it
is. Alas, this book comes too late for him, but I hope you&#8217;ll find it useful.</p>

<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>

<p>This book is for anyone who needs to deal with Linux or Unix-like
servers. If you&#8217;ve ever used the terms <em>systems administration</em>, <em>operations</em>, <em>deployment</em>, <em>configuration management</em>, or (sigh) <em>DevOps</em>, then you should find some value here.</p>

<p>Although I have managed my share of Linux servers, my background is in
software engineering. This means that the examples in this book tend
toward the deployment end of the spectrum, although I&#8217;m in agreement with <a href="#webops">Andrew Clay Shafer</a> that the distinction between deployment and configuration is unresolved.</p>

<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>

<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of book outlines: Chapter 1 covers so and so, Chapter 2 covers such and such, that sort of thing. I strongly suspect that nobody ever reads them (I never do), and the table of contents is much easier to scan.</p>

<p>This book is written to be read start to finish, with later chapters building on the earlier ones. It&#8217;s written largely in a tutorial style, so you should be able to follow along on your own machine. Most of the examples are focused on web applications.</p>

<h1>Online Resources</h1>

<p>Code samples from this book are available at this book&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/ansiblebook/ansiblebook">GitHub page</a>. There is ample official <a href="http://docs.ansible.com">Ansible documentation</a> available for reference.</p>

<p>I maintain a few Ansible quick reference pages on <a href="https://github.com/lorin/ansible-quickref">GitHub</a> as well.</p>

<p>The Ansible code is on <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">GitHub</a>. It was
previously spread out across three repositories, but as of Ansible
2.3, all of the code is maintained in a single repository.</p>

<p>Bookmark the <a href="http://bit.ly/1Dt75tg">Ansible module index</a>; you&#8217;ll be referring to it constantly as you use Ansible. <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com">Ansible Galaxy</a> is a repository of Ansible roles contributed by the community. The <a href="http://bit.ly/1Dt79ZT">Ansible Project Google Group</a> is the place to go if you have any questions about Ansible.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to Ansible development, check out the <a href="http://bit.ly/1Dt79ZT">Ansible Development Google Group</a>.</p>

<p>For real-time help with Ansible, there&#8217;s an active <em>#ansible</em> IRC channel on <em>irc.freenode.net</em>.</p>

<p>Supplemental material (code examples, exercises, etc.) is available for download at <a href="https://github.com/ansiblebook/ansiblebook"><em class="hyperlink">https://github.com/ansiblebook/ansiblebook</em></a>.</p>
